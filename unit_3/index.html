		<div id="about"><p>All designs, patterns, and XXX characters are thoughtfully created by LA-based designer, Jisung Solomon Ko. Jisung was diagnozed with autism at the young age of three. Despite certain limitations, troubling experiences, and many times being misunderstood, he found his outlet in creating his own characters - each with a name, crime-fighting purpose, and cool skills. Each character is personalized with unique quirks and no matter how different, they have the same heart to protect the world. Jisung studied art and japanese and is pursuing his undergraduate degree.
